# CLAUDE.md – libvbilbm

Library for reading and processing the Amiga IFF/ILBM graphics format.
Part of the WIME project, but a **separate Git repository**.

## Diary management

This subproject has its own `diary/` folder with entries specific to libvbilbm.
Summary entries go into the main WIME diary (`../diary/`).
The `diary/` folder will be created on the first entry.

When a LuaLaTeX summary diary is created, it will exist in two language versions:
- `diary/<name>.cs.tex` – Czech version
- `diary/<name>.en.tex` – English version
